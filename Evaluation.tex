\chapter{Evaluation}

What does figure ~\ref{SubstringsEx} then tell us, just by looking at it as it stands? With some minor deviances the beginning of both articles are identical. Then after the green box in the figure there is a huge gap in substrings. This tells us that the article along the x-axis the have a lot of text that is not shared with the article along the y-axis. Then towards the end of the articles they have a lot in common again. This would indicate that the article along the y-axis is an excerpt of the article along the x-axis. They would therefore both be articles about the same topic, and most likely are identical (in respects to the parts they have in common). This would seem like an article duplicate. The gaps in the axis thus tells us something about whether an article is a duplicate in the terms of a copy (all words are identical and both articles are of the same length(roughly)), if the article is a duplicate in the terms of being an excerpt, or if the articles have nothing in common.
